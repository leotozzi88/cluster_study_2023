The folder "analysis_main" contains the scripts used to generate and evaluate the biotypes described in the manuscript. The scripts should be run in the order specified as a number at the beginning of their file names.

The folder "analyses_competing_features" contains scripts that replicate the same analysis but using different imaging features as input, as described in the manuscript. The scripts should be run in the order specified as a number at the beginning of their file names.

The folder "rois" contains the regions of interest used to extract the activations and connectivity values from the imaging data. Each region name begins with the brain circuit it belongs to, followed by an anatomical label and the side. Please refer to the regions of interest table in the supplement for details.
